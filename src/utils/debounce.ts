/**
 * Creates a debounced version of a function, which delays the execution of the function
 * until after the specified delay time has elapsed since the last time the debounced
 * function was invoked. Optional immediate execution can be configured.
 *
 * @param fn - The function to debounce.
 * @param delay - The amount of delay in milliseconds before the function is invoked.
 * @param [options={}] - Optional configuration object for the debounced behavior.
 * @param [options.immediate=false] - If true, the function will be invoked immediately on the
 * first call instead of waiting for the delay.
 * @returns {AnyFn<void>} A debounced version of the supplied function.
